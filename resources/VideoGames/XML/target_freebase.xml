		<description>Heat is an upcoming video game, based on the 1995 crime film with the same name It is under development by Gearbox Software for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 During the E3 2009, Gearbox did not have the license of the film to make the game as it is being opened to be sold
Michael Mann, director of the film, is reported to be involved
In a recent interview Randy Pitchford President, CEO, and co-founder of Gearbox Software said that development of the game has been halted and the IP could potentially be available to pass onto another developer saying: 
'In a nutshell, we're nowhere We have passionate game makers that would love to do it We've got filmmakers that think it's a great idea that would love to see it done We have publishing partners that would love to publish it But we have no time That's the limiting factor Because of the situation, we're not keeping the IP locked down anymore So if somebody else were in a spot where they could do it, and everybody was comfortable with that, then conceivably that could happen'</description>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<description>Space Invaders is an arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978 It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media:  Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools
It was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry When first released, Space Invaders was very successful
The game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first 'killer app' for video game consoles Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions</description>

		<description>Ridiculous Fishing is a mobile fishing video game where players use motion and touch controls to catch fish and subsequently shoot them out of the sky for cash The game is known for its developers' battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company The game was developed and published by Vlambeer ;Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman ;and released for iOS on March 14, 2013, and later that year for Android;Players cast a fishing line into the ocean and use motion controls to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts Players then touch the screen to shoot fish out of the sky for money that can be spent on upgrades Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work and finish the game</description>
