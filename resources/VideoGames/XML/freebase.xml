in the game's story mode, players play napoleon bonaparte who leads the revolutionary army into battle against the british set in the late 18th century, napoleon's story is told in fire emblem fashion via strategic maps and character dialogue however, the game takes many liberties with historical accuracy, such as napoleon fighting man-eating ogres and abominable snowmen the objectives for the missions vary slightly, but the basic idea is to send out units, defeat the enemy and take over the opponent's stronghold</description>

michael mann, director of the film, is reported to be involved
in a recent interview randy pitchford president, ceo, and co-founder of gearbox software said that development of the game has been halted and the ip could potentially be available to pass onto another developer saying: 
'in a nutshell, we're nowhere we have passionate game makers that would love to do it we've got filmmakers that think it's a great idea that would love to see it done we have publishing partners that would love to publish it but we have no time that's the limiting factor because of the situation, we're not keeping the ip locked down anymore so if somebody else were in a spot where they could do it, and everybody was comfortable with that, then conceivably that could happen'</description>
